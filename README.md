## Hi, I'm Sahar ⋆˙⟡ 
🌟 I'm in my second year studying computer science at Arizona State University. <br/> 
🍵 I’m curious about everything from algorithms to aesthetics, and I love using CS as a toolkit to solve <br/> problems and create fun, meaningful projects! <br/> 
🌷 I’m currently learning about React Native and App Development. <br/> 
🎧 I like to spend my free time thrifting, working out, and being a [podcast](https://redcircle.com/shows/the-bookish-besties) host! <br/>
